3. How can you contribute to a project in github?
Ans: I contribute by putting commands from the working area to the  staging area and to the repository.
4. create a file called "yourname" and push to your remote repository
To begin with I created a file using the touch command
Using the git add command, I moved the file from the working area to the staging area.
And then I used the git commit command to move the file from my staging area to my local repository.
And finally I used the git push -u command to move the file from my local to my remote repo.
